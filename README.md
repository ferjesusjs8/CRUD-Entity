#Basic CRUD with EF and MVC

##About the project

###(This is not a tutorial ok :wink:)
####Basic CRUD using Entity Framework and MVC Layouts
This is a basic *CRUD Project* (Create, Read, Update, Delete), I'm using *MVC Template* (Model-View-Controller).
You can easily find those in *Visual Studio*, when you're creating a new project, then asp.net project, then select MVC.
You can download this project and then use "ctrl + f5" to run it
#####Hope you enjoy it!#####
